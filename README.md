Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Caira and I'm a recent CoderGirl graduate looking for work as a back-end C# game developer
I'm currently hard at work with my team on our capstone project you can follow at https://github.com/BabelFishies/SilverHippogryphs
In the meantime I've also started a Discord server with other CoderGirl grads where we're helping eachother learn Unity and begin to grow as game devs
