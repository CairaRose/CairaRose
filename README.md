Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Caira and I'm a recent CoderGirl graduate looking for work as a back-end C# game developer.
 I'm currently hard at work with my team on our capstone project you can follow at https://github.com/BabelFishies/SilverHippogryphs.
 In the meantime I've also started a Discord server with other CoderGirl grads where we're helping eachother learn Unity and begin to grow as game devs.
 If you want to reach me, you can find my LinkedIn here- https://www.linkedin.com/in/caira-rose-flynn/
